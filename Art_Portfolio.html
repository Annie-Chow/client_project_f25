    <section>
        <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
        <ul>
             <li><strong>Clarify Your Goal</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Write down in one sentence the type of job you’re applying for (e.g., “UX/UI designer at a tech startup,” “Illustrator for a publishing company,” “Media artist applying to museums”).</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Choose the Platform & Format</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Website → Good for design, illustration, interactive jobs.</li>
                  <li>PDF Deck → Good for applying directly to employers who ask for attachments (Try to keep it less than 15MB).</li>
                  <li>Printed Book → Good for gallery or in-person interviews (A3 or 11x17 size is common).</li>
                  <li>Video Reel → For animation or media jobs (60–90 seconds max).</li>
                  <li>Deliverable → Pick one main format + one backup (e.g., Website as main, PDF for emailing).</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Curate Your Best Work</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Gather all your projects (digital files, sketches, photos). Make a folder on your computer and named it</li>
                  <li>From this folder, pick your top 10–12 works using these rules:</li>
                    <li>
                         <ul>
                          <li>Strong technical execution (clean, well-presented).</li>
                          <li>Projects that represent the job you want.</li>
                          <li>At least 1–2 personal/passion projects to show originality.</li>
                         </ul>
                   
                </li>
             </ul>
             <li>
                <strong>Document Each Project</strong>
                 <ul>
                  <li>High-quality visuals: Professional photos, mockups, or screen captures.</li>
                  <li>Context and narrative: Write short text for each project (concept, process, tools used, outcome).</li>
                  <li>Process documentation: Show sketches, iterations, or behind-the-scenes if relevant.</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Add Professional Touches</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Resume/CV: Link or include at the end.</li>
                  <li>Contact info: Email, website, LinkedIn/Behance/Instagram (if relevant).</li>
                  <li>Logo or personal brand: Subtle but professional identity design.</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Test & Get Feedback</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Peer or mentor review: Ask friends, professors, or colleagues for honest critique.</li>
                  <li>User test: See if someone unfamiliar with your work can navigate your portfolio easily and understand your role in each project.</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Finalize & Export</strong></li>
             <li>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Web portfolio: Check mobile/desktop responsiveness.</li>
                 <li>PDF portfolio: Export under 15MB, use CMYK for print if needed.</li>
                 <li>Physical copy: Print on high-quality paper, bind professionally if possible.</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>This is a simple step to create a portfolio: start by clarifying your goal and the type of job you are targeting, then choose the right platform or format (website, PDF, print, or reel). Curate only your strongest 8–12 works and document each one with clear images and concise descriptions. Organize your portfolio with a strong introduction, well-structured project order, and consistent design. Tailor it for each application, add professional touches like a CV and contact info, and test it with mentors or peers. Finally, export it in the correct format, and keep it updated regularly as your skills and projects grow.</p>
